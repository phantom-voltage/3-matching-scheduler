## Chaos Week Scheduling

### Introduction

This project was part of the University of Washington's Math 480 Special Topics class with Professor Sarah Billey. The project involved working with community partners to solve problems with mathematical modeling. We worked with Dr. Jonah Ostroff at the University of Washington to help automate scheduling students to classes, teachers to classes, and classes to timeslots, all while avoiding time conflicts.

### To Do:

* Peer Review Changes
 * Explain why three simultaneous classes were chosen (in detail)
 * Explain the example of 3.6 (Davis)
 * Explain edge case of teacher assignment
 * Dr. Ostroff introduction
 * Explain 3-matching
 * Explain the variables used in end of 3.1 (page 3)
 * Reorganize / reimplement simplifications section
 * Clean up references section, put in Acknowledgements
  * Mention in beginning of paper how our problem is different, more complex, and faster than 2015
 * Other notes from Peer Review (Ethan's in particular)
* Explain why certain solving methods for GLPK work better than others.
 * Branching Pseudo-Cost Heuristic
 * Backtracking by best prediction heuristic
 * Cuts by mixed integer rounding
 * Are these parameters better in general for IP? For large scale problems? Or something more specific?
* Implement changes from notes from Billey, disregarding erroneous comma placement
* Are we consistent with all terms?
 * Chaos Week vs. Week of Chaos vs. "Chaos Week" vs. "Week of Chaos"
 * IP vs. LP
 * MathILy vs. MathILy-Er
* Testing
 * Run the algorithm over multiple schedules to find an average solving speed
 * Identify what are potential problems in schedules that cause for longer solving times
 * About how long should we run it to get a better solution once a BFS is found?
 * Write a function to generate random data that would represent teacher preferences and student preferences
 * Create a table showing computation times and preference total achieved
 * Get a monopoly on Pokemon cards

### Notes:
* I switched over the first draft file to second draft file, it's a WIP with some of the formulas filled in
* I took the liberty of changing MathILy-Er to MathILy. I don't think we need to be that specific and I think it's more confusing in its full form.
* I am unable to recreate the sub-optimal solution for 2015 that closely resembles Jonah's schedule.
 * Even with inefficient solver parameters, I am getting the better solution which diverges from Jonah's schedule.
 * Do we need to reword the section that references this? Or will we add this later?
* If you change indentation or line spacing within github's editor
 * Use "\indent" for indentation
 * Use "\\\" at the end of a paragraph for a new line
